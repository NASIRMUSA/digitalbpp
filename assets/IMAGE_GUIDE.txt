TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
==================
Until you have custom images, you can use these direct placeholder URLs:

For hero-business.png:
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1553877522-43269d4ea984?w=800&h=600&fit=crop

For about-business.png:
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1600880292203-757bb62b4baf?w=600&h=600&fit=crop

For client photos, use:
https://i.pravatar.cc/200?img=1  (for client-1.jpg)
https://i.pravatar.cc/200?img=12 (for client-2.jpg)
https://i.pravatar.cc/200?img=5  (for client-3.jpg)

HOW TO USE PLACEHOLDER URLS:
============================
Option 1: Download the images from the URLs above and save them in the assets folder

Option 2: Temporarily update the HTML to use the URLs directly:
- Open index.html
- Find: src="assets/hero-business.png"
- Replace with: src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1553877522-43269d4ea984?w=800&h=600&fit=crop"
- Repeat for other images

RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:
====================
1. Use placeholder images initially to see the design
2. Replace with custom images that match your brand
3. Optimize all images before final deployment (use TinyPNG.com)
4. Ensure all images are properly licensed for commercial use

IMAGE OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
========================
- Use WebP format for better compression
- Compress images to reduce file size (aim for <200KB per image)
- Use appropriate dimensions (don't upload 4K images if you only need 800px)
- Add descriptive alt text for SEO and accessibility
- Use lazy loading for images below the fold (already implemented in script.js)
